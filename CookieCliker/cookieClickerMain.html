Welcome to my Cookie Clicker Copycat. This is my first coding side project where I'm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the first time.
I started this project originally just for my computer, but depending on how far I get I will adapt the code to be more versitile and standardized

Current Features:
- A clickable big cookie that has some "Jiggle" physics when clicked and hovered Over
- An accurate Cookies per click and Cookies per Second counter that updates accordingly 
- 7 unlockable buildings
- 3 upgrades per building based on the number of each building owned (15,25,50)
- The spawning of golden cookies randomly on the screen

Features to add:
- Condese/seperate work into more readable files
- Fix the jiggle physics when clicking multiple times fast
- Work on how large numbers are displayed
- implement golden cookie effects
- implement different sounds
- implement the selling mechanic
- fix elements so the cursor becomes a pointer when hovering over
- Do something with the middle column
- Make things more efficient
- Clean up code

# Side-Projects
Welcome to my first GitHub repository. When I'm not working I plan on trying to code side-projects. Currently, I've only been able to work on an idle game that mimics the web game Cookie Clicker. It's my first time working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as doing frontend work like this.
